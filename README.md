# Chemodanchik

A little chemodanchik with the tools I'll certainly use.

## What is this?

A library that contains utility and helper methods that I find myself using very frequently.
I used to just copy-paste the code but recently I decided to create a library and wrap it in a package.

## What's inside?

Many things and I'll add more; for now a route transformer that makes endpoint routes look-like-this, i.e. transforms them to slug (or kebab) case.
